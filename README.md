# UnderwaterImageFusion

## Project Description
Underwater image enhancement system with fusion using only single image as input.

## Background
Capturing clear images in underwater environments is an important issue of ocean engineering. The effectiveness of applications such as underwater navigational monitoring and environment evaluation depend on the quality of underwater images. Capturing clear images underwater is challenging, mostly due to haze caused by color scatter in addition to color cast from varying light attenuation in different wavelengths. Color scatter and color cast result in blurred subjects and lowered contrast in underwater images.
